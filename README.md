# Financial News Sentiment Analysis and Dollar Pricing Prediction

This Python project utilizes sentiment analysis on world financial news data to predict the sentiment of the news along with the pricing of the dollar. It employs a Random Forest Regressor model for the prediction task.

## Overview

Financial markets are highly influenced by news and sentiments surrounding economic indicators and events. Understanding the sentiment of financial news articles can provide valuable insights for traders and investors. This project aims to leverage sentiment analysis techniques to predict the sentiment of financial news related to the dollar pricing.

The project involves the following steps:
1. Data Collection: Gathering financial news articles related to the dollar pricing from various sources.
2. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preprocessing the collected data for sentiment analysis.
3. Sentiment Analysis: Analyzing the sentiment of each news article using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.
4. Feature Engineering: Extracting relevant features from the sentiment analysis results and other data sources.
5. Model Training: Building a Random Forest Regressor model to predict the sentiment of the news along with the pricing of the dollar.
6. Model Evaluation: Evaluating the performance of the trained model using appropriate metrics.
7. Deployment: Integrating the trained model into an application or service for real-time sentiment prediction.

## Dependencies

This project requires the following dependencies:
- Python 3.11
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) for NLP tasks
- Financial news dataset (can be obtained from various financial news sources)
